## Content

### To Do
  - Write up Latex skeleton of the project
  - Add noisy node training to the equiformer model
  - Discuss into one or two papers out of the project
    - Push for one on active learning with some Bayesian flavour
    - One on the experimental design with the 3D information
    - Which new dataset to test?


### Follow up ideas: Thesis
  - Connect generative process with the active learning.
  - Apply framework on protein docking. 

#### Protein Docking:

Current state of the art is DiffDock. How exactly does it work? How is its confidence score computed?
  - Check MMG (_metric that Christoph Gorgulla was talking about_)
  - Can we use free-energy perturbation as a target?
